Currently working- my plants section (water calculator button only)- opens up a water calculator for each plant (hibiscus.html, rose.html, tulsi.html) that takes certain inputs and gives final output water quantity in Litres.
                 - weather forecast button that takes user to foreca.com (bangalore weather page where precipitation given in mm)
                 - Logout button takes user back to home page (index.html)
